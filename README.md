# NFS Prober
Golang NFS prober to measure mounting and read/write performance of multiple NFS instances. This has been tested on Google Cloud Filestore, but should work for any NFS instances. (Linux Only)

## Prepare NFS instances

Create a folder called 'prober' in the root level of each NFS target as this application can only mount to the directory called prober, for safety reasons. This can be done like shown below.
```sh
$ mount 192.168.1.2:/nfs1 mymount && mkdir mymount/prober
```

| --interval        | "60s"                  |    interval between each probe interation, valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"  |
| --timeout        | "250ms"                  |    timeout of probe operation, valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"  |
| --port        | 8080                  |    port for the web server to listen on  |
| --version        | "nfs"                  |    nfs version to use, eg: nfs, nfs4  |

### Using Docker
```bash
docker build -t nfs-prober .
docker run --privileged=true -p 8080:8080 nfs-prober --targets 192.168.1.2:/nfs0,192.168.1.3:/nfs1 --rw_test_files
```

### Metrics
Metrics are served in the log stdout or at: http://localhost:8080/metrics using prometheus data types https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/

## FAQ

-  Q: Could this potentially overwrite my files ?
-  A: No, unless you have any files in a folder called prober eg: '192.168.1.2:/nfs0/prober'. This application mounts the   NFS targets prober folder so the code can't access anything outside that. If the folder doesn't exist the probe fails, please see setup section above. As always please use your own testing and judgement before running in production.

-  Q: Can I use an interval of 5s or less ?
-  A: Yes, but you're simply wasting resources by doing this. Use a reasonable interval like 60s or more. 

-  Q: I'm getting the error err="operation not permitted", I have to use sudo or docker --privileged=true flag, this seems dangerous.
-  A: Yes it can be, but you have to mount the NFS instance and you need root privileges to do that. Don't run this prober on a machine that has a public IP.

- Q: Won't NFS cache the test files in some way since you're writing and reading to the same directory with the same file names ?
- A: No, every iteration of the prober reads random bytes from the "crypto/rand" library and writes them to the NFS, so every file is different each time.

-  Q: I don't like this or there's something wrong.
-  A: Submit an issue or a PR or simply fork the repo.
